# UOIT Thesis Template
This is the thesis template I modified from [Joe's undergradutate template](http://faculty.uoit.ca/macmillan/thesis_template.zip).

## How to use this template

Copy the necessary files into the same directory as your thesis.
The template is then loaded with `\documentclass{UOIT_Thesis}`

## Optional Arguments

There are three main options that can be passed to the class (as well as other arguments for the book class)
- `oneside` (creates a one sided document instead of two)
- `nocoat` (removes the coat of arms on the title page)
- `BW` (uses a greyscale coat of arms and black for the chapter titles)
