# UOIT Thesis Template
This is the thesis template I modified from [Joe's undergradutate template](http://faculty.uoit.ca/macmillan/thesis_template.zip).

## How to use this template

Copy the necessary files into the same directory as your thesis.
The template is then loaded with `\documentclass{UOIT_Thesis}`.

## Optional Arguments

There are four options that can be passed to the class (as well as other arguments for the book class)
- `oneside` Creates a one sided document instead of the default two
- `nocoat` Removes the coat of arms on the title page
- `BW` Uses a black coat of arms and black for the chapter titles
- `phd` Modifies Thesis Examination Information to include the additional committee member

Furthermore, if your university is not UOIT, within the `.tex` you can specify your institution by uncommenting the line `%\university{Your University}`.
